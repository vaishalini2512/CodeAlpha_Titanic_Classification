1. Introduction:
Welcome to the Titanic Classification Project! This project is part of a Data Science Internship of CodeAlpha, aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up the environment, and a guide to understanding and reproducing the results.

2. Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more. We will use Python and popular data science libraries to preprocess the data, engineer features, build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.

3. Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which is available on Kaggle. It consists of two CSV files:
titanic.csv: The training and test dataset containing features and the target variable (Survived).

4. Requirements:
To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries installed:

a. Python 3.x
b. Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
c. Pandas
d. NumPy
e. Scikit-learn
f. Matplotlib
g. Seaborn

5. Installation:
a. Clone the repository to your local machine:
Code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-classification.git
cd titanic-classification

b. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
Code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

c. Install the required packages:
Code
pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Project Structure:
The project directory is structured as follows:

7. Data Preprocessing:
In this step, we clean the data and handle missing values. Key tasks include:
a. Handling missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns.
b. Converting categorical variables to numeric using one-hot encoding.

8. Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. Some techniques used include:
a. Creating new features like FamilySize from SibSp and Parch.
b. Extracting titles from passenger names.

9. Modeling:
We build several machine learning models to predict survival, including:
a. Logistic Regression
b. Decision Trees
c. Random Forest
d. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
e. Gradient Boosting
We use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and select the best model.

10. Evaluation:
Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also use confusion matrices to visualize model performance.

11. Results:
The final model's performance is summarized, highlighting the accuracy and other relevant metrics on the test dataset.

12. Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a classification model, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to modeling and evaluation. The best-performing model is then used to make predictions on the test dataset.
